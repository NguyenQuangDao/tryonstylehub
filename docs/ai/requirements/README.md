# Requirements & Problem Understanding - AIStyleHub

## Problem Statement
**What problem are we solving?**

Online fashion shopping suffers from high return rates (30-40%) because customers cannot visualize how clothing items will look on them before purchasing. Traditional e-commerce relies on static product photos or generic model images that don't represent diverse body types, skin tones, or personal styles.

**Who is affected by this problem?**
- Online fashion shoppers who want to see how clothes look on them before buying
- E-commerce retailers facing high return rates and customer dissatisfaction
- Fashion enthusiasts seeking personalized style recommendations

**Current situation/workaround:**
- Customers buy multiple sizes/items and return what doesn't fit
- Rely on size charts and reviews (unreliable)
- Limited AR try-on tools that require specific device capabilities
- Manual style consultation is expensive and not scalable

## Goals & Objectives
**What do we want to achieve?**

### Primary Goals
1. Enable realistic virtual try-on using AI (GPT-4 Vision + DALL-E 3)
2. Provide intelligent outfit recommendations based on style preferences (GPT-4o)
3. Allow users to edit and customize images with AI assistance
4. Connect users directly to sellers for seamless purchasing

### Secondary Goals
- Reduce decision time for online fashion purchases
- Build a product catalog with 50+ items from multiple sellers
- Achieve < 30 second response time for try-on generation
- Maintain cost-effective operations ($100-500/month for 1000-5000 users)

### Non-Goals
- Physical try-on or AR features (out of scope)
- Payment processing (direct to seller websites)
- Inventory management or fulfillment
- Mobile app development (web-first approach)
- User authentication system (Phase 1)

## User Stories & Use Cases

### Virtual Try-On
**As a fashion shopper**, I want to upload my photo and a clothing item image, so that I can see how the clothing would look on me before purchasing.

**Workflow:**
1. User navigates to try-on page
2. Uploads personal photo (JPG/PNG, < 5MB)
3. Uploads clothing item image (from seller or own photo)
4. Optionally adds custom prompt for styling preferences
5. Clicks "Try On with AI" button
6. Waits 15-30 seconds while AI processes
7. Views generated try-on image
8. Can download result or try different items

**Edge cases:**
- Invalid image formats or sizes
- Poor quality/unclear images
- Multiple people in the photo
- Unusual clothing items (accessories only, full body suits)
- Network timeout during processing

### AI Style Recommendations
**As a fashion enthusiast**, I want to describe my desired style, so that the AI can recommend complete outfits from available products.

**Workflow:**
1. User enters style description (e.g., "casual summer beach outfit")
2. System queries product database
3. GPT-4o analyzes style and matches products
4. Returns 3-5 coordinated items (top, bottom, accessories, shoes)
5. Displays products with images, prices, and shop links
6. User clicks through to seller website to purchase

**Edge cases:**
- Vague style descriptions
- No matching products in database
- Incompatible combinations
- Out of stock items

### Image Editing
**As a creative user**, I want to edit fashion images using AI, so that I can customize clothing colors, patterns, or backgrounds.

**Workflow:**
1. User uploads image to edit
2. Optionally uploads mask to specify edit area
3. Enters edit prompt (e.g., "change shirt to red with stripes")
4. Selects edit mode (with mask = DALL-E 2, without = DALL-E 3)
5. Waits 5-20 seconds
6. Views edited image
7. Can iterate with additional edits

## Success Criteria
**How will we know when we're done?**

### Functional Criteria
- ✅ Virtual try-on generates realistic images in < 30 seconds
- ✅ Image editing supports both masked and prompt-based editing
- ✅ Recommendation system suggests 3-5 relevant products
- ✅ All features work on desktop browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- ✅ Shopping links direct to correct seller product pages

### Performance Criteria
- Response time < 30s for try-on (target: 15-25s)
- Response time < 20s for image editing (target: 5-15s)
- Response time < 10s for recommendations (target: 2-5s)
- 95% success rate for valid inputs
- Cache hit rate > 70% to reduce costs

### Quality Criteria
- Generated images look natural and realistic
- Clothing fits proportionally to body
- Colors and patterns preserved from original clothing
- No visible artifacts or distortions
- Outfit recommendations are stylistically cohesive

### Cost Criteria
- < $0.10 per try-on request
- < $0.08 per edit request
- < $0.02 per recommendation request
- Monthly costs: $100-500 for 1000-5000 active users

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- OpenAI API rate limits (5 req/min for try-on, 10 req/min for editing)
- Image size limit: 5MB per upload
- DALL-E 3 only supports 1024x1024, 1024x1792, 1792x1024
- GPT-4 Vision has token limits for image analysis
- Need server-side processing (cannot run in browser)

### Business Constraints
- Initial launch with 50-100 mock products (no real inventory)
- Links to external sellers (no commission tracking)
- No user accounts or saved history (Phase 1)
- Limited budget for OpenAI API (~$50-100 for testing phase)

### Time Constraints
- 5-7 weeks total development time
- Week 1: Design and analysis
- Weeks 2-3: Backend development
- Weeks 3-4: Frontend development
- Week 5: Integration and testing
- Weeks 6-7: Deployment and documentation

### Assumptions
- Users have modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- Users will upload clear, well-lit photos
- Clothing images are on neutral backgrounds (for best results)
- Internet connection is stable enough for 15-30s processing
- OpenAI APIs remain available with current pricing
- Mock data is sufficient for demonstration purposes

## Questions & Open Items

### Technical Questions
- ✅ Should we implement user authentication? **Answer: No, not in Phase 1**
- ✅ How do we handle NSFW content detection? **Answer: OpenAI has built-in moderation**
- ✅ What database to use? **Answer: SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL for production**
- ⏳ Should we support video try-on? **Decision: Future phase**
- ⏳ How to optimize image preprocessing? **Research: Image compression techniques**

### Business Questions
- ⏳ How to track conversion to seller sites? **Decision: Analytics integration in Phase 2**
- ⏳ Should we add user reviews or ratings? **Decision: Phase 2 feature**
- ⏳ How to handle seller partnerships? **Decision: Start with public product images**

### Research Needed
- Optimal image formats and preprocessing for DALL-E
- Best prompting strategies for GPT-4 Vision try-on analysis
- Caching strategies to maximize hit rate
- Error recovery patterns for OpenAI API failures
- A/B testing framework for UI improvements
